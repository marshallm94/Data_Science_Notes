# Notes

An assortment of data science notes, although I foresee the *data science* qualification potentially fading away, leading to a repo of notes about anything that I might find noteworthy...

This repo will intentionally have a very flat structure, which is to say notes will not be organized into sub-directories. The idea here is to enable the user (namely myself) to be able to search fore files from the command line and locate all files where an answer might be located.

There are some files that have LaTex in them, and therefore should be read using an application that supports the rendering of LaTex. I currently use [Typora](https://typora.io/), which renders LaTeX nicely and the output can be exported to various filetypes.
