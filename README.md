# Notes

An assortment of data science notes, although I foresee the *data science* refinement potentially falling away, leading to a repo of anything that I might find noteworthy.

This repo will intentionally have a very flat structure, which is to say notes will not be organized into sub-directories. The idea here is to enable the user (namely myself) to be able to `grep` from the CL for a topic at the base directory level, and locate all files where an answer might be located.

There is a fare amount of mathematical notation in some of the files. They were written in Atom, accompanied by the [markdown-preview-enhanced](https://atom.io/packages/markdown-preview-enhanced) package, which I would recommend installing in order for everything to render.
