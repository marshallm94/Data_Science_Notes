# Notes

An assortment of data science notes, although I foresee the *data science* refinement potentially falling away, leading to a repo of anything that I might find noteworthy.

This repo will intentionally have a very flat structure, which is to say notes will not be organized into sub-directories. The idea here is to enable the user (namely myself) to be able to `grep` from the CL for a topic at the base directory level, and locate all files where an answer might be located.
