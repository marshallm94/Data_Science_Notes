# Unbiased Estimation

* A parameter is associated with a population.
* A statistic is associated with a sample.
* A statistic is **biased** if it systematically overestimates or underestimates a parameter.
* A statistic is **unbiased** if it does systematically overestimate or underestimate a parameter.

Everything we care about is an estimator; the sample mean estimates the population mean, the sample variance estimates
the population variance, the statistical learning model built on the sample estimates the statistical model that
generates the population.


$$
\begin{align}

E[\hat{\theta}] & = \theta \\

\text{For example:} \\

E[\bar{X}] & = \mu
